title: Reference Schemas
---

This section documents our analysis of the various Bib(La)TeX based 
reference schemas.

We consider

* [BibLaTex](biblatex.html) This extension of BibLaTeX, represents our 
new internal reference management system.

* [BibTex](bibtex.html) The most standard but aging reference tool for 
LaTeX.

* [AMSrefs](amsrefs.html) Along with BibTex, AMS prefer/allow 
references to be submitted in AMSrefs format. So if we ever submit to 
an AMS journal we need to convert our internal BibLaTeX references to 
AMSrefs.

* [Aigaion](aigaion.html) This is a dump of the schema as used by our 
old reference management system. It was a fairly simple extension of 
BibTex.
