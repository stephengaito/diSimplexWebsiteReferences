# BibTeX field types: Taken from section 3.2 (Fields)

address:
  type: field ( text )
  comment: |
    Usually the address of the publisher or other type of institution. For 
    major publishing houses, van Leunen recommends omitting the informa- 
    tion entirely. For small publishers, on the other hand, you can help 
    the reader by giving the complete address.
  biblatex:
  - location

annote:
  type: field ( text )
  comment: |
    An annotation. It is not used by the standard bibliography styles, but 
    may be used by others that produce an annotated bibliography. author 
    The name(s) of the author(s), in the format described in the L A TEX 
    book.
  biblatex:
  - annotation

booktitle:
  type: field ( text )
  comment: |
    Title of a book, part of which is being cited. See the L A TEX book for 
    how to type titles. For book entries, use the title field instead.
  biblatex:
  - booktitle

chapter:
  type: field ( number )
  comment: A chapter (or section or whatever) number.
  biblatex:
  - chapter

crossref:
  type: field ( text )
  comment: The database key of the entry being cross referenced.
  biblatex:
  - crossref

edition:
  type: field ( number )
  comment:
    The edition of a book—for example, “Second”. This should be an ordinal, 
    and should have the first letter capitalized, as shown here; the 
    standard styles convert to lower case when necessary.
  biblatex:
  - edition

editor:
  type: list ( name )
  comment: |
    Name(s) of editor(s), typed as indicated in the L A TEX book. If there 
    is also an author field, then the editor field gives the editor of the 
    book or collection in which the reference appears.
  biblatex:
  - editor

howpublished:
  type: field ( text )
  comment: |
    How something strange has been published. The first word should be 
    capitalized.
  biblatex:
  - howpublished

institution:
  type: field ( text )
  comment: The sponsoring institution of a technical report.
  biblatex:
  - institution

journal:
  type: field ( text )
  comment: |
    A journal name. Abbreviations are provided for many journals; see the 
    Local Guide.
  biblatex:
  - journaltitle

key:
  type: field ( text )
  comment: |
    Used for alphabetizing, cross referencing, and creating a label when 
    the “author” information (described in Section 4) is missing. This 
    field should not be confused with the key that appears in the \cite 
    command and at the beginning of the database entry.
  biblatex:
  - sortkey

month:
  type: field ( text )
  comment: |
    The month in which the work was published or, for an unpublished work, 
    in which it was written. You should use the standard three-letter 
    abbreviation, as described in Appendix B.1.3 of the LATEX book. note 
    Any additional information that can help the reader. The first word 
    should be capitalized. NOTE: BibLaTeX now uses a number rather than a 
    text field.
  biblatex:
  - month

number:
  type: field ( number )
  comment: |
    The number of a journal, magazine, technical report, or of a work in a 
    series. An issue of a journal or magazine is usually identified by its 
    volume and number; the organization that issues a technical report 
    usually gives it a number; and sometimes books are given numbers in a 
    named series.
  biblatex:
  - number

organization:
  type: field ( text )
  comment: | 
    The organization that sponsors a conference or that publishes a manual.
  biblatex:
  - organization

pages:
  type: field ( range )
  comment: |
    One or more page numbers or range of numbers, such as 42--111 or 
    7,41,73--97 or 43+ (the ‘+’ in this last example indicates pages 
    following that don’t form a simple range). To make it easier to 
    maintain Scribe- compatible databases, the standard styles convert a 
    single dash (as in 7-33) to the double dash used in TEX to denote 
    number ranges (as in 7--33).
  biblatex:
  - pages

publisher:
  type: field ( text )
  comment: The publisher’s name.
  biblatex:
  - publisher

  comment: |

    the title field gives its title and an optional series field gives the 
    name of a series or multi-volume set in which the book is published.

  biblatex:

year:
  type: field ( number )
  comment: |
    The year of publication or, for an unpublished work, the year it was 
    written. Generally it should consist of four numerals, such as 1984, 
    although the standard styles can handle any year whose last four 
    nonpunctuation characters are numerals, such as ‘(about 1984)’.
