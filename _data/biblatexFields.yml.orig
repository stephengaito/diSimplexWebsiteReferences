  type: field (literal)
  comment: |
    This field may be useful when implementing a style for annotated 
    bibliographies. it is not used by all standard bibliography styles.

    An”. Style authors should note that Biblatex automatically copies the 
    value of the title field to indextitle if the latter field is 
    undefined.

institution:
  type: list (literal)
  comment: |
    The name of a university or some other institution, depending on the

    individual issues are identified by a designation such as ‘Spring’ or 
    ‘Summer’ rather than the month or a number. Since the placement of 
    issue is similar to month and number, this field may also be useful 
    with double issues and other special cases. See also month, number, and

    missing. For example, when an author-year citation style is generating 
    a citation for an entry which is missing the author or the year, it may 
    fall back to label. See § 2.3.2 for details. Note that, in contrast to 
    shorthand, label is only used as a fallback. See also shorthand.

language:

location:
  type: list (literal)
  comment: |
    The place(s) of publication, i. e., the location of the publisher or 
    institution, depending on the entry type. Traditional BibTeX uses the

  comment: An annex to the maintitle, to be printed in a different font.

month:
  type: field (datepart)
  comment: |
    The publication month. This must be an integer, not an ordinal or a

  comment: |
    The number of a journal or the volume/number of a book in a series. See 
    also issue as well as §§ 2.3.7 and 2.3.9. With @patent entries, this is

    field as well, but handles it in a special way. See § 2.3.7 for 
    details.

#
# Special Fields
#
# The fields listed in this section do not hold printable data but 
# serve a different purpose. They apply to all entry types in the 
# default data model.

crossref:
  type: field (entry key)
  comment: |
    This field holds an entry key for the cross-referencing feature. Child 
    entries with a crossref field inherit data from the parent entry 
    specified in the crossref field. If the number of child entries 
    referencing a specific parent entry hits a certain threshold, the 
    parent entry is automatically added to the bibliography even if it has 
    not been cited explicitly. The threshold is settable with the 
    mincrossrefs package option from § 3.1.2.1. Style authors should note 
    that whether or not the crossref fields of the child entries are 
    defined on the Biblatex level depends on the availability of the parent 
    entry. If the parent entry is available, the crossref fields of the 
    child entries will be defined. If not, the child entries still inherit 
    the data from the parent entry but their crossref fields will be 
    undefined. Whether the parent entry is added to the bibliography 
    implicitly because of the threshold or explicitly because it has been 
    cited does not matter. See also the xref field in this section as well 
    as § 2.4.1.

entryset:
  type: field (separated values)
  comment: |
    This field is specific to entry sets. See § 3.11.5 for details. This 
    field is consumed by the backend processing and does not appear in the 
    .bbl.

execute:
  type: field (code)
  comment: |
    A special field which holds arbitrary TeX code to be executed whenever 
    the data of the respective entry is accessed. This may be useful to 
    handle special cases. Conceptually, this field is comparable to the 
    hooks \AtEveryBibitem, \AtEveryLositem, and \AtEveryCitekey from § 
    4.10.6, except that it is definable on a per-entry basis in the bib 
    file. Any code in this field is executed automatically immediately 
    after these hooks.

gender:
  type: 'field (Pattern matching one of sf, sm, sn, pf, pm, pn, pp)'
  comment: |
    The gender of the author or the gender of the editor, if there is no 
    author. The following identifiers are supported: sf (feminine singular, 
    a single female name), sm (masculine singular, a single male name), sn 
    (neuter singular, a single neuter name), pf (feminine plural, a list of 
    female names), pm (masculine plural, a list of male names), pn (neuter 
    plural, a list of neuter names), pp (plural, a mixed gender list of 
    names). This information is only required by special bibliography and 
    citation styles and only in certain languages. For example, a citation 
    style may replace recurrent author names with a term such as ‘idem’. If 
    the Latin word is used, as is custom in English and French, there is no 
    need to specify the gender. In German publications, however, such key 
    terms are usually given in German and in this case they are 
    gender-sensitive.

langid:
  type: field (identifier)
  comment: |
    The language id of the bibliography entry. The alias hyphenation is 
    provided for backwards compatibility. The identifier must be a language 
    name known to the babel/polyglossia packages. This information may be 
    used to switch hyphenation patterns and localize strings in the 
    bibliography. Note that the language names are case sensitive. The 
    languages currently supported by this package are given in table 2. 
    Note that babel treats the identifier english as an alias for british 
    or american, depending on the babel version. The Biblatex package 
    always treats it as an alias for american. It is preferable to use the 
    language identifiers american and british (babel) or a language 
    specific option to specify a language variant (polyglossia, using the 
    langidopts field) to avoid any possible confusion. Compare language in 
    § 2.2.2.

langidopts:
  type: field (literal)

    For polyglossia users, allows per-entry language specific options. The 
    literal value of this field is passed to polyglossia’s language 
    switching facility when using the package option autolang=langname. For 
    example, the fields:<pre>

        langid     = {english},
        langidopts = {variant=british},

    </pre>would wrap the bibliography entry in:<pre>

        \english[variant=british]
            ...
        \endenglish
    </pre>
ids:
  type: field (separated list of entrykeys)
  comment: |
    Citation key aliases for the main citation key. An entry may be cited 
    by any of its aliases and Biblatex will treat the citation as if it had 
    used the primary citation key. This is to aid users who change their 
    citation keys but have legacy documents which use older keys for the 
    same entry. This field is consumed by the backend processing and does 
    not appear in the .bbl.

indexsorttitle:
  type: field (literal)
  comment: |
    The title used when sorting the index. In contrast to indextitle, this 
    field is used for sorting only. The printed title in the index is the 
    indextitle or the title field. This field may be useful if the title 
    contains special characters or commands which interfere with the 
    sorting of the index. Consider this example:<pre>

        title          = {The \LaTeX\ Companion},
        indextitle     = {\LaTeX\ Companion, The},
        indexsorttitle = {LATEX Companion},

    </pre>Style authors should note that Biblatex automatically copies 
    the value of either the indextitle or the title field to 
    indexsorttitle if the latter field is undefined.

keywords:
  type: field (separated values)
  comment: |
    A separated list of keywords. These keywords are intended for the 
    bibliography filters (see §§ 3.6.2 and 3.11.4), they are usually not 
    printed. Note that with the default separator (comma), spaces around 
    the separator are ignored.

options:
  type: field (separated key = value options)
  comment: |
    A separated list of entry options in key = value notation. This field 
    is used to set options on a per-entry basis. See § 3.1.3 for details. 
    Note that citation and bibliography styles may define additional entry 
    options.

presort:
  type: field (string)
  comment: |
    A special field used to modify the sorting order of the bibliography. 
    This field is the first item the sorting routine considers when sorting 
    the bibliography, hence it may be used to arrange the entries in 
    groups. This may be useful when creating subdivided bibliographies with 
    the bibliography filters. Please refer to § 3.5 for further details. 
    Also see § 4.5.5. This field is consumed by the backend processing and 
    does not appear in the .bbl.

related:
  type: field (separated values)
  comment: |
    Citation keys of other entries which have a relationship to this entry. 
    The relationship is specified by the relatedtype field. Please refer to 
    § 3.4 for further details. relatedoptions field (separated values) 
    Per-type options to set for a related entry. Note that this does not 
    set the options on the related entry itself, only the dataonly clone 
    which is used as a datasource for the parent entry.

relatedtype:
  type: field (identifier)
  comment: |
    An identifier which specified the type of relationship for the keys 
    listed in the related field. The identifier is a localized bibliography 
    string printed before the data from the related entry list. It is also 
    used to identify type-specific formatting directives and bibliography 
    macros for the related entries. Please refer to § 3.4 for further 
    details.

relatedstring:
  type: field (literal)
  comment: |
    A field used to override the bibliography string specified by 
    relatedtype. Please refer to § 3.4 for further details.

sortkey:
  type: field (literal)
  comment: |
    A field used to modify the sorting order of the bibliography. Think of 
    this field as the master sort key. If present, Biblatex uses this field 
    during sorting and ignores everything else, except for the presort 
    field. Please refer to § 3.5 for further details. This field is 
    consumed by the backend processing and does not appear in the .bbl.

sortname:
  type: list (name)
  comment: |
    A name or a list of names used to modify the sorting order of the 
    bibliography. If present, this list is used instead of author or editor 
    when sorting the bibliography. Please refer to § 3.5 for further 
    details. This field is consumed by the backend processing and does not 
    appear in the .bbl.

sortshorthand:
  type: field (literal)
  comment: |
    Similar to sortkey but used in the list of shorthands. If present, 
    Biblatex uses this field instead of shorthand when sorting the list of 
    shorthands. This is useful if the shorthand field holds shorthands with 
    formatting commands such as \emph or \textbf. This field is consumed by 
    the backend processing and does not appear in the .bbl.

sorttitle:
  type: field (literal)
  comment: |
    A field used to modify the sorting order of the bibliography. If 
    present, this field is used instead of the title field when sorting the 
    bibliography. The sorttitle field may come in handy if you have an 
    entry with a title like “An Introduction to...” and want that 
    alphabetized under ‘I’ rather than ‘A’. In this case, you could put 
    “Introduction to...” in the sorttitle field. Please refer to § 3.5 for 
    further details. This field is consumed by the backend processing and 
    does not appear in the .bbl.

sortyear:
  type: field (literal)
  comment: |
    A field used to modify the sorting order of the bibliography. If 
    present, this field is used instead of the year field when sorting the 
    bibliography. Please refer to § 3.5 for further details. This field is 
    consumed by the backend processing and does not appear in the .bbl.

xdata:
  type: field (separated list of entrykeys)
  comment: |
    This field inherits data from one or more @xdata entries. Conceptually, 
    the xdata field is related to crossref and xref: crossref establishes a 
    logical parent/child relation and inherits data; xref establishes as 
    logical parent/child relation without inheriting data; xdata inherits 
    data without establishing a relation. The value of the xdata may be a 
    single entry key or a separated list of keys. See § 3.11.6 for further 
    details. This field is consumed by the backend processing and does not 
    appear in the .bbl.

xref:
  type: field (entry key)
  comment: |
    This field is an alternative cross-referencing mechanism. It differs 
    from crossref in that the child entry will not inherit any data from 
    the parent entry specified in the xref field. If the number of child 
    entries referencing a specific parent entry hits a certain threshold, 
    the parent entry is automatically added to the bibliography even if it 
    has not been cited explicitly. The threshold is settable with the 
    mincrossrefs package option from § 3.1.2.1. Style authors should note 
    that whether or not the xref fields of the child entries are defined on 
    the Biblatex level depends on the availability of the parent entry. If 
    the parent entry is available, the xref fields of the child entries 
    will be defined. If not, their xref fields will be undefined. Whether 
    the parent entry is added to the bibliography implicitly because of the 
    threshold or explicitly because it has been cited does not matter. See 
    also the crossref field in this section as well as § 2.4.1.

# Field Aliases
#
# The aliases listed in this section are provided for backwards 
# compatibility with traditional BibTeX and other applications based on 
# traditional BibTeX styles. Note that these aliases are immediately 
# resolved as the bib file is processed. All bibliography and citation 
# styles must use the names of the fields they point to, not the alias. 
# In bib files, you may use either the alias or the field name but not 
# both at the same time.

address:
  type: list (literal)
  comment: |
    An alias for location, provided for BibTeX compatibility. Traditional 
    BibTeX uses the slightly misleading field name address for the place of 
    publication, i. e., the location of the publisher, while Biblatex uses 
    the generic field name location. See §§ 2.2.2 and 2.3.4.

  comment: |
    An alias for institution, provided for BibTeX compatibility. The 
    institution field is used by traditional BibTeX for technical reports 
    whereas the school field holds the institution associated with theses. 
    The Biblatex package employs the generic field name institution in both 
    cases. See §§ 2.2.2 and 2.3.4.
