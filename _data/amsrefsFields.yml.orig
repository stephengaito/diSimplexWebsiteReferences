# Simple fields

accessdate:
  type: field ( date )
  comment: |
    Used to specify the date on which a webpage was viewed, as op- posed to 
    the date on which the resource was last modified, which would be put in 
    the date field.
  biblatex:
  - urldate

address:
  type: field ( text )
  comment: |
    Usually the address of the publisher or other issuing organization, but 
    inside the conference compound field (see page 13) it refers to the 
    address of the conference.
  biblatex:
  - location

booktitle:
  type: field ( text )
  comment: |
    Used in the article type to specify the title of the book in which the 
    article appeared. If anything other than a simple book title is 
    required, the book compound field should be used instead.
  biblatex:
  - booktitle

date: 
  type: field ( date )
  comment: |
    Usually the date of publication, except inside the conference field, 
    where it is the date of the conference (see page 13).
    <p>This replaces BibTEX’s year and month fields. Its value should be 
    written in ISO 8601 format, e.g., 1967-02-24. The day and/or month can 
    be omitted, so all of the following are valid representations of 
    February 24, 1967:<pre>

        date = {1967-02-24}
        date = {1967-02}
        date = {1967}

    </pre>Using this format allows amsrefs maximum flexibility in formatting 
    dates, for example, by allowing month names to be printed in full or 
    abbreviated as necessary.</p>
    <p>For “Winter”, “Spring”, “Summer”, “Fall”, either use month numbers of
    13, 14, 15, 16 (respectively) or just put in the text before the year:<pre>

        date = {Summer 1987},

    </pre>For compatibility, year is provided as an alias for date, but its 
    use is discouraged.</p>
  biblatex:
  - date

edition:
  type: field ( text )
  comment: |
    For books or reports. If the value of this field is a simple number, 
    \bib will convert it to cardinal form and add “ed.” (or alternative 
    text if specified by the bibliography style). Otherwise it will be 
    printed as is.
  biblatex:
  - edition

eprint:
  type: field ( text )
  comment: |
    Electronic preprint information such as for www.arXiv.org. See 
    http://xxx.lanl.gov/help/faq/references for recommended form.
  biblatex:
  - eprint

hyphenation:
  type: field ( text )
  comment: |
    This corresponds to the Babel package notion of “language”. The 
    hyphenation language used for a given \bib entry is determined from 
    various clues, which are checked in the following order:
    <ol>
      <li>The Babel language specified by the hyphenation field.</li>
      <li>The Babel language specified by the first word of the language
          field (after lowercasing).</li>
      <li>The current Babel language that was in effect before the \bib 
          command started.</li>
      <li>The current hyphenation patterns of the document, if there are
          no Babel language modules loaded.</li>
    </ol>
    The hyphenation field applies to an entire entry. To change the Babel 
    language for a single field, see the discussion of the language 
    attribute on page 21.
    <p>NOTE: BibLaTex does not have true equivalent for hyphenation</p>
  biblatex:
  - language

journal:
  type: field ( text )
  comment: none
  biblatex:
  - journaltitle

label:
  type: field ( text )
  comment: |
    When the alphabetic or shortalphabetic options are used, amsrefs will 
    usually try to generate the label on its own. If necessary, you can 
    override the automatically generated label by specifying a label field.
  biblatex:
  - label

language:
  type: field ( text )
  comment: |
    Language of the work. The language name should be the printed form, not 
    a Babel-style language name, since in principle this field could 
    contain more complicated remarks such as “Russian, with French ab- 
    stract”. Cf. hyphenation.
  biblatex:
  - language

note:
  type: field ( text )
  comment: |
    Any additional information that does not fit into one of the other fields.
  biblatex:
  - note

number:
  type: field ( number )
  comment: |
    The issue number of the journal for an article or the technical report 
    number for a report.
  biblatex:
  - number

organization:
  type: field ( text )
  comment: |
    The school, university, corporation, or other nonpublisher orga- 
    nization that issued the document.
  biblatex:

    “unpublished” with journal articles.
  biblatex:

subtitle:
  type: field ( text )

    Typically used with a multipart journal article to give a subtitle for
    each part, but it can also be used for books.

# Compound fields

# These are the compound fields currently supported by amsrefs.

book:
  type: compound ( latex )
  comment: |
    This is used for conference articles to make it easier to differenti- 
    ate between an article and the book or proceedings that it appeared in. 
    The book field can contain any of the following subfields: title, part, 
    subtitle, edition, editor, translator, contribution, series, volume, 
    publisher, organization, address, date, note.
    <p>It is often used in conjunction with the conference field.</p>
    <p>NOTE: BibLaTeX has no direct equivalent to the field book.
    use the entries inbook/book instead.</p>

    The conference field can contain a title, address, and date.<pre>

contribution:
  type: compound ( latex )
  comment: |
    This field can be repeated as many times as necessary to list any 
    contributors other than authors, editors, or translators.<pre>

        contribution={
          type={illustrations},
          author={Gorey, Edward}
        }

    </pre>which in the default style produces<pre>

       with illustrations by Edward Gorey

    </pre>Since contributions are potentially complicated, so is the 
    contribution field:
    <ul>
      <li>Sometimes it is necessary to add additional material to the type in
        order to produce intelligible text:<pre>
 
          contribution={
            type={an appendix},
            author={Doe, John}
          }

      </pre></li>
      <li>amsrefs tries very hard to format multiple contributions, each of
        which may have multiple authors, in an appropriate way. However,
        there might be cases where the default rules aren’t flexible enough,
        in which case you can instead use the contribution field as a simple
        field and format it exactly the way you want:<pre>

          contribution={some arbitrary text about contributions}

        </pre>This feature should only be used as a last resort, though.</li>
    </ul>

    This is used with the article type for multipart articles. Like the 
    contribution field, it is repeatable. It can contain any of the 
    following fields: part, subtitle, contribution, journal, volume, date, 
    number, pages.<pre>

    This is the only compound field that can be used with any bib-
